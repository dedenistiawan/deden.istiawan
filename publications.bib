              Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes
              1,2
              and molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type
              3,4
              . Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7\% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (

              −8
              ) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores

              in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.},

              Genetic effects on changes in human traits over time are understudied and may have important pathophysiological impact. We propose a framework that enables data quality control, implements mixed models to evaluate trajectories of change in traits, and estimates phenotypes to identify age-varying genetic effects in GWAS. Using childhood BMI as an example trait, we included 71,336 participants from six cohorts and estimated the slope and area under the BMI curve within four time periods (infancy, early childhood, late childhood and adolescence) for each participant, in addition to the age and BMI at the adiposity peak and the adiposity rebound. GWAS of the 12 estimated phenotypes identified 28 genome-wide significant variants at 13 loci, one of which (in
              DAOA)
              has not been previously associated with childhood or adult BMI. Genetic studies of changes in human traits over time could uncover unique biological mechanisms influencing quantitative traits.},
