- abstract: Analysis about level of bankruptcies in the banking firm is
    usually reflected on finance report and it need to do because bank
    is necessary institute on economy. The method that can be used is
    logistic regression. It is generally used to determine a
    relationship between response variable which has only two or more
    possible values with one or more predictor variable.
