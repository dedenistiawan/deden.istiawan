- abstract: AbstractType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease
    that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes 1,2 and
    molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type 3,4 .
    Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes
    across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study
    data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% not of European ancestry),
    including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent
    association signals at genome-wide significance ( P  \<\< 5 × 10 −8
    ) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge,
    previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of
    T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of
    cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are
    differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open
    chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial
    cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific
    partitioned polygenic scores 5 in a further 279,552 individuals of
    diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their
    association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific
    partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery
    disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic
    nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of
    obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes.
    Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry
    genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to
    disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the
    development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to
    optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.

- abstract: We postulated that T2D predisposes to exocrine pancreatic
    diseases through (epi)genetic mechanisms. We explored the methylome
    (methylationEPIC arrays) of the exocrine pancreas of 141 donors,
    assessing the impact of T2D. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS)
    for T2D identified a hypermethylation in an enhancer of the
    Pancreatic-Lipase-Related-Protein 1 (PNLIPRP1) gene, associated with
    decreased PNLIPRP1 expression. PNLIPRP1 null variants (in 191K
    participants of the UKbiobank) associated with elevated glycemia and
    LDL-cholesterol. Mendelian Randomisation using 2.5M SNP OmniArrays
    in 111 donors evidenced that T2D was causal of PNLIPRP1
    hypermethylation, which was causal for LDL-cholesterol. Further
    AR42J rat exocrine cell studies demonstrated that Pnliprp1 knockdown
    induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a known pre-pancreatic cancer
    state, and increased cholesterol levels, reversible with statin.
    This (epi)genetic study suggests a role for PNLIPRP1 in human
    metabolism and on exocrine pancreas function with potential
    implications for pancreatic diseases.

- abstract: AbstractGenetic effects on changes in human traits over time
    are understudied and may have important pathophysiological impact.
    We propose a framework that enables data quality control, implements
    mixed models to evaluate trajectories of change in traits, and
    estimates phenotypes to identify age-varying genetic effects in
    GWAS. Using childhood BMI as an example trait, we included 71,336
    participants from six cohorts and estimated the slope and area under
    the BMI curve within four time periods (infancy, early childhood,
    late childhood and adolescence) for each participant, in addition to
    the age and BMI at the adiposity peak and the adiposity rebound.
    GWAS of the 12 estimated phenotypes identified 28 genome-wide
    significant variants at 13 loci, one of which (in DAOA) has not been
    previously associated with childhood or adult BMI. Genetic studies
    of changes in human traits over time could uncover unique biological
    mechanisms influencing quantitative traits.

- abstract: We postulated that T2D predisposes to exocrine pancreatic
    diseases through (epi)genetic mechanisms. We explored the methylome
    (methylationEPIC arrays) of the exocrine pancreas of 141 donors,
    assessing the impact of T2D. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS)
    for T2D identified a hypermethylation in an enhancer of the
    Pancreatic-Lipase-Related-Protein 1 (PNLIPRP1) gene, associated with
    decreased PNLIPRP1 expression. PNLIPRP1 null variants (in 191K
    participants of the UKbiobank) associated with elevated glycemia and
    LDL-cholesterol. Mendelian Randomisation using 2.5M SNP OmniArrays
    in 111 donors evidenced that T2D was causal of PNLIPRP1
    hypermethylation, which was causal for LDL-cholesterol. Further
    AR42J rat exocrine cell studies demonstrated that Pnliprp1 knockdown
    induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a known pre-pancreatic cancer
    state, and increased cholesterol levels, reversible with statin.
    This (epi)genetic study suggests a role for PNLIPRP1 in human
    metabolism and on exocrine pancreas function with potential
    implications for pancreatic diseases.
